Simple-Shell
============

This shell runs on UN*X operating systems and has redirection, pipelinig, and background capabilities.  The shell was made to be robust and avoid crashing above all else.  CTRL-D, CTRL-C, and exit all quit the shell.  The skeleton shell code of implementing a shell was taken from http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Implementing-a-Shell.html#Implementing-a-Shell.
